# homebrew-terminal-utils
macOS Homebrew formulas to install my terminal utilities

This is a [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) tap for formulas for software developed by me and my friends

## Setup
Using these formulas requires Homebrew, which in turn requires Xcode.

Once Homebrew is installed, simply run
```Shell
brew tap hsuantinglu/terminal-utils
```

## Use
To install software, just use `brew install <name-of-formula>`.
You may wish to run `brew update` before hand to get the latest version of the formula.

To upgrade:
```Shell
brew update
brew upgrade  # To upgrade all formulas installed with Homebrew
brew upgrade <name-of-formula>  # To upgrade a specific one
```
